SuperExport.jsx

A Photoshop script that lets you save parts of a PSD as separate cropped
files by carefully naming the Photoshop layers.  For example, if you name
a layer "Background.jpg" and run this script, that layer will be saved and
all others will be hidden.



GETTING STARTED (INSTALLATION)

Installing a photoshop script means dropping the script (*.jsx file) into Photoshop's scripts directory.  For me, the path is:

MAC: /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS5/Presets/Scripts
PC: c:\program files\Adobe Photoshop CS5\Presets\Scripts

So the easiest way to get going is to copy "SuperExport.jsx" to:
/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS5/Presets/Scripts/SuperExport.jsx

Once you restart Photoshop, a new menu item will show up in the menu File > Scripts > Super Export.  Just click on that menu item and the script will run.

I made a keyboard shortcut [F5] to run it automatically, Here's how:
1) Choose Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts...
2) Highlight "Super Export" under File > Scripts
3) Click under the 'Shortcut' column and type the [F5] key (or whatever you want)
4) If there are conflicts, choose 'Accept & Continue', otherwise choose 'Accept'
